Samples - Slicer/randomiser
Drumkits - Loops... (bank switch change drumkit)
Pads - Stretch...
Bits(oldschool noise) - Loops/random
Mp3 player - Play speed
Radio frequencies
Acid (loops)

TODO: Change current sample pitch etc when sample is playing

-------------------------------------------------------
Get a drumkit samples directory,
	generate a line of thoses samples randomly picked
	and also choose part of the samples to play/stop
	for 5 seconds for ex. Use the seed to get them back.
	
	We can imagine a second pass to repeat/stutter part
	of this samples line with distortions or whatever...
	(of course it can also be other samples than drumkits)

Realtime sample time stretch and FX
	Able to apply realtime modifications to samples
	instead of what we have now, we can set effect parameters
	using knobx then play a sample, instead we should slow
	or speed up sample play for ex in realtime while it is played
	and for that we most likely need a C/C++ player including FXs,
	that we can connect to in TCP mode for example to
	redefine sample play parameters on the fly.
	And that's about it. Maybe we can hack the sox/play binary
	since it open source and already support what we want,
	but only in preprocessed way...gotta have a look.
