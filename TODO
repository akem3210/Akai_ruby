It would be nice to have a global detuner
by hacking play/sox to listen on a port to
apply effects in realtime (as opposed to defined once on start then locked)
we need to do it in reverse, the ruby client listen on a port
then all the play instances connect to this server and wait for input
to modify the current samples playing.




-------------------------------------------------------
Samples - Slicer/randomiser		: OK BUT TODO: FIX THE LAST KNOB TO SET START POSITION
SynthPads - 				: OK
Drumkits - Loops...			:
Bits(oldschool noise) - Loops/random	:
Mp3 player - Play speed			:
Radio frequencies			:
Acid (loops)				:

TODO: Change current sample pitch etc when sample is playing
	NEEDS PLAY/SOX HACK, SEE BEGINING OF THIS DOC.
-------------------------------------------------------
Get a drumkit samples directory,
	generate a line of thoses samples randomly picked
	and also choose part of the samples to play/stop
	for 5 seconds for ex. Use the seed to get them back.
	
	We can imagine a second pass to repeat/stutter part
	of this samples line with distortions or whatever...
	(of course it can also be other samples than drumkits)
